# AI-Upscaling
This uses EDSR to upscale a video by three times

Most of the working code has been taken from the following site: https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-based-super-resolution-with-opencv-4fd736678066

I have just added the functionality of handling video

The EDSR model can be found by this repo: https://github.com/Saafke/EDSR_Tensorflow/tree/master/models

To know more about video handling using OpenCV, check this: https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_video_display/py_video_display.html

For using cv2.dnn_superres, and CUDA libraries, you will have to biuld OpenCV from source, for this:
 
1) If you are using Google Colab (can be extended to Linux)

2) If you want t0 install in Windows

Enjoy, and have a Wonderful Day üòÅ
